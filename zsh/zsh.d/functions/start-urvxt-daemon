# This is a function to check if the URXVT daemon is currently running.
#
# If this function is called and URXVT is not running then it will start it;
# otherwise, nothing happens.  This function's main purpose is to prohibit
# multiple copies of the daemon from being started, usually due to reloading
# the windowing system's configuration file repeatedly.
